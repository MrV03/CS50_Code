Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO
None. There were no specific predictions that were consistently incorrect as the number of simulations increased.
The team rankings and winning chances were all relatively stable with minor fluctuations within a minimum range.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO
After around 10,000 simulations it maybe considered "good enough". Beyond this, computational cost will increase
significantly (as indicated by the longer time) and the improvement in stability becomes less pronounced. To balance
accuracy and computational efficiency, 10,000 seems like a reasonable compromise for stable predictions.
